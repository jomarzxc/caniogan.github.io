        <img src="img/birth-registration.jpg" alt="Birth Registration Image">
        <p>Birth registration in Barangay Caniogan is a vital process that ensures the official recording of births and issuance of birth certificates to newborns. It is a fundamental right of every child and serves as a legal document establishing their identity, nationality, and parentage.</p>
    
        <p>Parents or guardians are responsible for registering the birth of their child within a specified period after the date of birth, as mandated by law. The process typically begins with the submission of a Certificate of Live Birth (COLB) application form to the barangay's Civil Registry Office.</p>
    
        <p>The COLB application form requires essential information about the child, including their full name, date and place of birth, sex, parents' names, and other pertinent details. Parents must ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information provided to avoid delays or discrepancies in the birth registration process.</p>
    
        <p>Upon submission of the COLB application form, barangay officials review the application and verify the information provided. This may involve cross-checking with hospital records or conducting interviews with the parents to confirm the details of the birth.</p>
    
        <p>Once the birth registration is processed and approved, the barangay issues a Birth Certificate to the child, which serves as an official legal document of their birth. The Birth Certificate contains vital information such as the child's full name, date and place of birth, parents' names, and other relevant details.</p>
    
        <p>In addition to serving as proof of identity and nationality, the Birth Certificate is required for various purposes, including enrolling children in school, obtaining government services and benefits, and facilitating international travel and immigration processes.</p>
    
        <p>It is essential for parents to ensure the timely registration of their child's birth to avoid any complications or legal issues in the future. Failure to register a child's birth may result in difficulties in accessing essential services and rights, such as education, healthcare, and citizenship.</p>
    
        <p>Barangay Caniogan is committed to facilitating the birth registration process and ensuring that every child's right to a legal identity is upheld. By promoting awareness and providing support to parents, the barangay aims to ensure that every child is registered at birth and has access to their fundamental rights and entitlements.</p>
