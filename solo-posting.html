These services may include counseling and psychosocial support, skills training and employment assistance, legal aid and advocacy, and childcare and educational subsidies.</p>
    
        <p>Furthermore, Barangay Caniogan promotes awareness and advocacy efforts to empower solo parents and raise public consciousness about the challenges they face. Through information campaigns, workshops, and community outreach activities, the barangay seeks to foster understanding, empathy, and support for solo parents within the community.</p>
    
        <p>By recognizing the rights and needs of solo parents and providing them with access to essential services and support, Barangay Caniogan endeavors to create an inclusive and supportive environment where solo parents can thrive and fulfill their roles as nurturing and resilient caregivers.</p>
